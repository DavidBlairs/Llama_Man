# Llama_Man
This is a pygame based PAC-MAN clone using a llama instead of PAC-MAN. In order to run it, clone the repo and run the file `main.py`. You'll need to have pygame installed and python 3 minimum. There arnt any levels. The goal is to collect as many items as possible. This is easier said than done because the ghosts have a very competant path finding algorithm.
